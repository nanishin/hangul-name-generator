# hangul-name-generator.pl
==========================

### Hangul Name Generator based on Choseong/Jungseong/Jongseong Condition
* Original seed script was gotten from other Korean blog (http://ac18rt.blogspot.kr/2009/08/perl.html)
* I had used this script twice to decide name of my two daughters (2009 and 2012).
* Based on the horoscopic data and the Theory of Yin and Yang and the Five Elements,
* available Choseong/Jungseong/Jongseong (3 elements to make one Korean chracter) groups are decided.

## Example
* In current script, first character of entire name is fixed with my family name (i.e. SHIN/신/申).

    > $ ./hangul-name-generator.pl > naming_result
